Description

- To build a Website using React framework and API. 


Technical Used
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Ajax (axios) for API
- Postman

Initiation
- At the initiation stage, in order to create the wireframe of the designs, I used Miro to help me visualise the designs and set up my process flow thoughts.
- Once I have the concept of the designs ready, I created a basic react functionality to render images into the website from a API fetch
- Upon a successful fetch and render, a test deployment to Vercel was executed

Implementation
- I tried different approaches towards on how I implemented my codes
- The best method that worked for me, was to have the design concept for the page ready and then start implementing the codes base don the design, so that I have control. 

APIs used
- RAWG API
