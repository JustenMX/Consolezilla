# Gamex - Track Your Favourite Games

<img src="./public/LogoV1.png" width="50">

On days where I destress, I will always find joy connecting with my friends over Call of Duty multiplayer. Gamex is a React Application designed to pull content from one of the biggest gaming databases via RestAPI, so that I can keep track of my favourite console games.

## Features

- Search for your favourite games
- Pagination for easy browsing
- Simple favourites list to keep track of your top games

## Technologies Used

- React
- Rest API from [RAWG](https://rawg.io)

## Project Background

Gamex was developed as part of my project work during the General Assembly Software Engineering program. It served as a way for me to apply my skills in building a frontend application that interacts with an external API.

## Getting Started

To get started with Gamex, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JustenMX/Gamex.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Future Enhancements

I plan to work on the following enhancements for Gamex:

- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness for a better user experience
- [ ] Implement a dark theme for a more immersive gaming atmosphere
- [ ] Add more user functionalities, such as user authentication and game reviews
